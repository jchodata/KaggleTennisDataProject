# Tennis Data Analysis Project

## Description
This project explores a rich dataset of professional tennis matches, players, and rankings. The primary focus is on analyzing player performance, historical trends, and match dynamics using SQL and Python. Through detailed SQL queries, we gain insights into player rankings, winning percentages, and year-over-year performance, along with generating visualizations for better interpretation.

The project provides an excellent example of working with sports datasets and showcases how SQL and Python can be leveraged for data analysis and visualization.

## Languages and Utilities Used
- **SQL**
- **Python** (for querying and visualizations)

---

## Environments Used
- **Windows 10**
- **SQLite** (via `%sql` magic in Jupyter Notebook)

---

## Program Walkthrough:

### 1. Setting Up the Project
- The SQLite database file containing tennis data is loaded and connected.
- Tables such as `matches`, `players`, and `rankings` are explored to understand their structure and relationships.

### 2. Key Analyses Performed
#### a. **Top Players**
- Analyze and identify the all-time top players based on maximum points and best rank.

#### b. **Yearly Player Rankings**
- Create yearly player rankings to visualize trends and highlight top players for each year.

#### c. **Winning Percentages**
- Calculate all-time winning percentages for right-handed vs. left-handed players to explore how playing style impacts outcomes.

### 3. Key Insights & Visualizations
